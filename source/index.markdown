Currently, I’m a PhD student in Human Robot Interaction (HRI) at the Human Interface Technology Laboratory New Zealand (HITLabNZ), which is part of the university of Canterbury. I’m also a full stack developer, android developer, prototyping enthusiast, User Experience Designer, entrepreneur and design thinking tutor. In short, I’m involved in anything that is in hardware or software.

In other words, I do what I love :D

# Work experience

<section class="card">
## HRI/HCI Research
##### USA (2014/06 - 2014/10)
** Fuse Labs - Microsoft Research **
[{% img shadowImg http://fuse.microsoft.com/content/img/fuse_logo.png %}](http://fuse.microsoft.com/)

During my time at the FUSE Labs (Microsoft Research) I developed with Kati London and Noah Liebman a two tier tool to persuade co-workers to do more (mico)exercises during work hours. The reason for that was that most societies move to a more and more rigid office type workplace which creates many long term health issues. The two tier were divided into a screen based notification system and a social robot (NAO) based notification system. My main part of the project was to develop the robot side and implement it's navigation and persuasion algorithms.

**Technologies Used**

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) Used as webserver as well as NAO script language
* [NAOqi](http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-1/naoqi/index.html) Is the SDK used to control [NAO](https://www.aldebaran.com/en/humanoid-robot/nao-robot) robots
